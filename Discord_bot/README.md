This project is called "car website". This website informs the users about cars. This project was built by Alvin Biju (me) and Ghassan . We built it together as a final project for an intro to web development course. We used HTML, CSS and Blender to create this project. The project consists of 4 html pages which references each other. The different pages gives a description about different cars along with a brief history and its characteristics.
